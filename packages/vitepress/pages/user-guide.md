## Document types and collections
Here in Redot Academy we have chosen to categorize and organize our learning material into three different document types.

### Track
A track is an overarching collection of tutorials with some added guidence along the way.
For example the `3rd Person 3D Action RPG` track will guide you through the neccessary
[Tutorials](#tutorials) to learn how to make the fully functional game.
Tracks can make use of the same [Tutorials](#tutorials) and
[Factiods](#factoids).

### Tutorials
A tutorial is a document that takes on one and sometimes a few aspects needed as part of a
[Track](#track) to make a game. The tutorials can be used in multiple tracks and sometimes also be referenced from other [Tutorials](#tutorials).

### Factoids
A factoid is a smaller piece of information that may be used and referenced throughout the Redot Academy in [Tracks](#track) and [Tutorials](#tutorials).
